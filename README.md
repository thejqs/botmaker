Make a Twitter bot and you can too
==================================

Or something like that. 

After I made my first couple Twitter bots, I thought I might like a handy little template to make more. This is set up in Django to use Python to run Tweepy and store the tweets in a MySQL database. It's also done this way with the idea you might want to use a Django management command to run the bot on a server crontab -- but no worries if not. Just don't use that part.

Clone the repo, pip install from the reqs.txt file for the dependencies you'll need, and you're on your way.

Happy tweeting and, y'know, try to be more funny than evil.
